**What we look for in new club members:**
- Strong desire to design and create something new  
- Open to working and collaborating with different people
- Some prior knowledge of game mechanics
- Understanding of some computing languages, preferably C# 
- Commitment 

**Laptop Requirement:** Though 8GB of RAM is fine we recommend having at least 16GB, a core i5, a decent GPU (capable of running Unity)

**Available Spots:** There are 6 available spots in the club open. If you wish to apply fill out this [**Form**](https://forms.gle/fsUaYrV4isZp4cSz5), please note you have to fill out the form individually not in                        groups.
